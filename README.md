# game-of-life
Game of life implementation in Ruby using the Gosu Game Library.
 
# What is the Game of Life?
The Game of Life (more specifically Conway's Game of Life) is is a cellular automaton made by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. 
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. 

# Dependencies
Ruby must be installed on your computer. You can install version 2.7.2 of Ruby here (if you are using Windows): https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

# How to use:
1. Double-click on the "gameoflife.rb" file. A console window will launch.

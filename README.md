# game-of-life
Game of life implementation in Ruby using the Gosu Game Library.
 
# What is the Game of Life?
The Game of Life (more specifically Conway's Game of Life) is a cellular automaton made by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. 
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. 
The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

# Dependencies
Ruby must be installed on your computer. You can install version 2.7.2 of Ruby here (if you are using Windows): https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

# How to download and use:
1. Click on the green "code" button. From its drop-down menu, select "Download ZIP".
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Open the extracted folder, and double-click on the "installdependencies.bat" file. This will install the require library for this to work.
4. Double-click on the "gameoflife.rb" file. A console window will launch.
5. Follow the prompts' directions inside of the console window.
6. When done, another window should launch with an empty black grid and some yellow text.
   The text gives directive on further use of the application.
